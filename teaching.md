<p>I believe that professional and personal success, growth, and happiness stem from a supportive environment that fosters life-long learning and curiosity. I am extremely passionate about mentoring and teaching students in both computational and wet-lab skills. My role as a mentor and instructor has been carried out through various outlets - either from one-on-one mentoring, formal course instruction, or short workshop modules. I have taught computational workshops as a <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Certified Carpentries Instructor</a> and short modules as a co-chair of the <a href="https://combee-uw-madison.github.io/studyGroup/">Computational Biology, Ecology, Evolution (ComBEE)</a> study group. I've also enjoyed mentoring undergraduate and masters students running lab-scale wastewater bioreactors. </p>
