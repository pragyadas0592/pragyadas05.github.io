title: Microbial Ecology of Engineered Water Systems
---

<p> Microbial communities are an integral component of engineered water systems that are designed to improve public health, the environment, and overall water infrastructure and quality. Adequately understanding the ecology and evolution of microbial lineages underpinning engineered water systems will allow for more predictable and sustainable biotechnologies. Since most of the microorganisms underpinning these systems remain uncultivated to date, I use a combination of enrichment techniques and multi-omics approaches to connect theoretical microbial ecology findings to engineering principles. </p>

<p> I use lab-scale bioreactors enriched with microbial communities simulating bioprocesses as a semi-complex model system for testing new hypotheses in microbial ecology and developing new toolkits. During my PhD, I studied self-assembled microbial communities simulating enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), an important biological wastewater treatment technology. EPBR processes harness the unique metabolic capabilities of phosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) and remove orthophosphate through incorporating chains of polyphosphate into their biomass. A model PAO is '<i>Candidatus</i> Accumulibacter phosphatis', which can be readily enriched for in lab-scale bioreactors. However, these bioreactors also host a diverse "flanking community." I aimed to characterize ecological interactions and evolutionary dynamics of these bioreactor communities in the context of ecosystem function.</p>

<p> In my postdoctoral work, I am focused on characterizing the composition and activity of methane-producing communities underlying anaerobic digestion (AD) technologies for biogas production. Anaerobic digestion is a promising biotechnology for renewable biogas production and recovering valuable resources from organic waste streams. These processes rely on the coordinated activity of hydrogen-producing bacteria (acetogens/syntrophic acetate oxidizers) and methane-producing archaea (methanogens). I am applying stable-isotope probing approaches with multi-omics of methane-producing enrichment communities to understand how the taxonomical composition of these communities connects to <i> in situ </i> physiologies under different external perturbations.</p> 

<p>Incorporating insights from the basic microbial ecology of these systems with engineering principles will allow for more predictable and resilient technologies. I am also passionate about open and reproducible workflows in bioinformatics and multi-omics research.</p>
