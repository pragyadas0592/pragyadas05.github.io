<p>Hello! My name is Pragya Das, and I am currently pursuing my second masters (MS) in Disaster Management & Environmental Impact (DAMAGE) at the IMT MINES in Ales, France. </p> Currently studying and exploring fields related to Environmental Disaater Management and Risk Analysis. Having experienced working with satellite Imageries and relevant softwares engaged me into going deeper in the field of exploring disasters and specially factors causing them and how to control, manage and mitigate them.  I am interested in fields related to Environmental Conservation and Monitoring using satellite based imageries and GIS based models. 

</p>I have completed my Bachelor's in Engineering with Honours in Civil Engineering and y first post graduate degree as MTech in Remote Sensing from <a href="http://www.banasthali.org/banasthali/wcms/en/home/index.html/">Microbiology Doctoral Training Program</a> Banasthali University,Rajasthan, India with thesis on hydrologocal VIC modeling under the supervision of Dr.P.V.Raju from National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC) (a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/about-isro/national-remote-sensing-centre-nrsc") ISRO, Telangana, India()</a> studying lab-scale enrichment systems simulating phosphorus removal using multi-omics techniques. Prior to moving to Madison, I received my B.S. in Biology with a minor in Statistics at the University of Arkansas - Fayetteville. I was an undergraduate research assistant in <a href="https://www.thelewislab.com/">Dr. Jeffrey Lewis' Lab</a> studying natural variation of stress responses in yeast.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am very committed to reproducible and open research practices, and am passionate about helping other researchers with their analytical challenges. I am currently a certified <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Carpentries</a> instructor and previously co-chaired the <a href="https://combee-uw-madison.github.io"> Computational Biology, Ecology, and Evolution</a> (ComBEE) group at UW-Madison.</p>
