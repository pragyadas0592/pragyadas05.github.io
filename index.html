<p>Hello! My name is Elizabeth McDaniel, and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. I am interested in exploring the microbial ecology of engineered water systems using enrichment techniques and multi-omics approaches to design more sustainable biotechnologies. I am currently a joint postdoc in the labs of Dr. Ryan Ziels and Dr. Steven Hallam in the Departments of Civil Engineering and Microbiology and Immunology working on the microbial ecology of anaerobic digestion systems.</p>

<p>I received my PhD in the <a href="https://microbiology.wisc.edu/">Microbiology Doctoral Training Program</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with Dr. Katerhine McMahon studying lab-scale enrichment systems simulating phosphorus removal using metagenomic techniques. Prior to moving to Madison, I received my B.S. in Biology with a minor in Statistics at the University of Arkansas - Fayetteville. I was an undergraduate research assistant in <a href="https://www.thelewislab.com/">Dr. Jeffrey Lewis' Lab</a> studying natural variation of stress responses in yeast.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am very committed to reproducible and open research practices, and am passionate about helping other researchers with their analytical challenges. I am currently a certified <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Carpentries</a> instructor and previously co-chaired the <a href="https://combee-uw-madison.github.io"> Computational Biology, Ecology, and Evolution</a> (ComBEE) group at UW-Madison.</p>
