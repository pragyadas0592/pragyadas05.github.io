<p>Hello! My name is Pragya Das, and I am currently pursuing my second masters (MS) in Disaster Management & Environmental Impact (DAMAGE) at the IMT MINES in Ales, France.
</p> Currently studying and exploring fields related to Environmental Disaater Management and Risk Analysis. Having experienced working with satellite Imageries and relevant 
softwares engaged me into going deeper in the field of exploring disasters and specially factors causing them and how to control, manage and mitigate them.  I am interested
in fields related to Environmental Conservation and Monitoring using satellite based imageries and GIS based models. 
</p>I have completed my Bachelor's in Engineering with Honours in Civil Engineering and post graduate degree as MTech in Remote Sensing from <a href="http://www.banasthali.org/banasthali/wcms/en/home/index.html/">
Banasthali University,Rajasthan, India</a>  with thesis on hydrologocal VIC modeling under the supervision of Dr.P.V.Raju from <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/about-isro/national-remote-sensing-centre-nrsc"> 
National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC), ISRO, Telangana, India()</a>.</p> 
Prior to moving to Ales, I worked as a Lecturer in Indira Gandhu Agricultural University, Chhattisgarh India. I also worked as a freelance Image Analyst at The Center
For GIS Technology, Chhattisgarh, India, before joining as a lecturer <a href="https://www.thelewislab.com/">Dr. Jeffrey Lewis' Lab</a> studying natural variation of stres
s responses in yeast.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am very committed to reproducible and open research practices, and am passionate about helping other researchers with their analytical challenges.</p>
