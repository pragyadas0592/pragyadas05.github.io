<p>Hello! My name is Elizabeth McDaniel, and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. I am interested in exploring the microbial ecology of engineered water systems using enrichment techniques and multi-omics approaches to design more sustainable biotechnologies. I am currently a joint postdoc in the labs of <a href="https://www.zielslab.com/">Dr. Ryan Ziels</a> and <a href="https://hallam.microbiology.ubc.ca/">Dr. Steven Hallam</a> in the Departments of Civil Engineering and Microbiology and Immunology working on the microbial ecology of anaerobic digestion systems.</p>

<p>I received my PhD in the <a href="https://microbiology.wisc.edu/">Microbiology Doctoral Training Program</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with <a href="https://mcmahonlab.wisc.edu/">Dr. Katherine McMahon</a> studying lab-scale enrichment systems simulating phosphorus removal using multi-omics techniques. Prior to moving to Madison, I received my B.S. in Biology with a minor in Statistics at the University of Arkansas - Fayetteville. I was an undergraduate research assistant in <a href="https://www.thelewislab.com/">Dr. Jeffrey Lewis' Lab</a> studying natural variation of stress responses in yeast.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am very committed to reproducible and open research practices, and am passionate about helping other researchers with their analytical challenges. I am currently a certified <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Carpentries</a> instructor and previously co-chaired the <a href="https://combee-uw-madison.github.io"> Computational Biology, Ecology, and Evolution</a> (ComBEE) group at UW-Madison.</p>
