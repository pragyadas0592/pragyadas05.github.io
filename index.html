<p>Hello! My name is Pragya Das, and I am currently pursuing my second master's (MS) in Disaster Management & Environmental Impact (DAMAGE) at the IMT MINES in Ales, France.
</p> I am currently studying and exploring fields related to Environmental Disaster Management and Risk Analysis. Having experienced working with satellite Imageries and 
relevant software engaged me in going deeper in the area of exploring disasters, especially the factors causing them and how to control, manage and mitigate them. I am 
interested in environmental conservation and monitoring fields using satellite-based imageries and GIS-based models. 
</p> I have completed my Bachelor's in Engineering with Honours in Civil Engineering and y first post-graduate degree as MTech in Remote Sensing from <a href="http://www.banasthali.org/banasthali/wcms/en/home/index.html/">
Banasthali University,Rajasthan, India</a> with a thesis on hydrological VIC modeling under the supervision of Dr.P.V.Raju from <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/about-isro/national-remote-sensing-centre-nrsc"> 
National Remote Sensing Center (NRSC), ISRO, Telangana, India</a>.</p> 
Before moving to Ales, I worked as a Lecturer at Indira Gandhi Agricultural University, Chhattisgarh, India. I also worked as a freelance Image Analyst at The Center For GIS
Technology, Chhattisgarh, India, before joining as a lecturer.</p>

<p>Additionally, I am very committed, open to various research and work-oriented practices, and passionate about helping others with their analytical challenges.</p>
