Elizabeth McDaniel, PhD <br>
<a href = "mailto: elizabethmcd93@gmail.com">elizabethmcd93@gmail.com</a> <br>

The best way to contact me is at the email address above. For peer-review requests, I am happy to review manuscripts submitted to journals broadly in the field of microbial ecology with a minimum 2-week turnaround time. My specific expertise spans environmental microbiology, microbial ecology of engineered water systems, and multi-omics approaches (specifically genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics). <br>

I strive to practice reproducible and open research by publicly providing associated code and datasets with each of my publications. For each manuscript on my [Publications](https://elizabethmcd.github.io/publications/) page, I have provided a PDF copy for download, links to code workflows available on Github, datasets on Figshare, and/or genomes/meta-omics datasets available on NCBI. Should you have any problems downloading a manuscript that may be behind a paywall for you, or have any questions about my code/datasets, please do not hesitate to contact me at the email address above.
